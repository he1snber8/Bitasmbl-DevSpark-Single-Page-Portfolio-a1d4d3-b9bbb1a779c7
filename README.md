# Bitasmbl-DevSpark-Single-Page-Portfolio-a1d4d3-b9bbb1a779c7

## Description
Build a modern, responsive single-page portfolio landing site for a junior developer using React and Tailwind CSS, emphasizing mobile-first layout, clear sections (hero, about, projects, contact), simple animations, and clean, readable component architecture suitable for deployment on Vercel.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Requirements
- Implement a mobile-first layout where all sections look good on a small screen before adding desktop enhancements.
- Use clear, reusable React components for each main section (Hero, About, Projects, Contact) instead of a single large file.
- Add at least one subtle animation or transition using Tailwind utilities (e.g., hover effects, fade-in on load, button states).
- Ensure navigation uses anchor links that smoothly scroll to each section and remains usable on mobile.
- Deploy the built React + Tailwind SPA so it is accessible via a public URL (e.g., Vercel).
